Thank you for choosing this PHPVibe plugin!

To use it simply upload the contents to your /root folder.
Make sure the files in /moderator go into /moderator, or into the new name you gave your admin folder (if different).

Once uploded you will see a Youtube import link in the left menu of the admin panel.
