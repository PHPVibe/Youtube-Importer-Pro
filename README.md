The YouTube importer for PHPVibe is a module that allows users to import videos from YouTube directly into their PHPVibe-powered website.


You would need to obtain a YouTube Data API key from the Google Developers Console. This key is necessary for accessing YouTube data, including video details and metadata.


Once installed, PHPVibe integrates the YouTube Data API to fetch data and information about the requested YouTube videos.


You can easily import:


- Youtube search results

- Youtube Channel videos

- Playlists
